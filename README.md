# Temporal_Theil_Scaling_py
 The temporal fluctuation scaling is a power law between the variance t and the mean of a non-stationary time series. In this repository, the temporal evolution of the temporal fluctuation scaling exponent is studied using the results of the article https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.106.014117
